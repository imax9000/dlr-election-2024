## Nomination

I am delighted to announce that I will be running for re-election in the Dún Laoghaire LEA in the local elections this June. I have been actively involved in politics since the mid 1990s and a councillor for People Before Profit in Dún Laoghaire since 2011 campaigning on a wide variety of issues locally and nationally.

In this time I have played a key role in many campaigns both in the constituency and on a national level. This includes:

*    A successful campaign to stop a vulture fund evicting tenants from St Helen’s Court apartments in Dún Laoghaire.
*    A leading figure in the Save Our Seafront Campaign. Played a key role in the campaign to restore Dún Laoghaire Baths as a public amenity and to stop oil exploration in Dublin Bay.
*    Currently campaigning to take ferry terminal building back into public control and for a municipal watersports centre in the harbour.
*    Along with Richard Boyd Barrett has represented hundreds of local people with housing, education, welfare and pension issues.
*    A key organiser in the successful Save Our Forests campaign to stop the FG/Labour attempt in 2012 to sell off our forests.
*    Founded Repeal the 8th Campaign Dún Laoghaire in 2015 and organised the activist campaign that led to a comprehensive victory for women’s rights in 2018.
*    Worked with Monkstown Boxing Club to get its own clubhouse which is finally under construction.
*    Worked with Brid Smith TD on legislation to prohibit fossil fuel extraction


Social and Affordable housing is my number 1 priority. I have campaigned to stop no-fault evictions, to support those suffering from the government’s disastrous housing policy and to build marches and rallies for homes for all.
If re-elected I will fight for the following housing demands in the council:

*    The Council must build social housing and stop leaving houses vacant for months on end.
*    Ensure that more than the mandatory 10 % of developer homes are allocated to the council for social and affordable.
*    End dereliction and vacancy by taking these buildings into council ownership.
*    Ramp up the council’s housing acquisition programme to ensure homes for immediate allocation.
*    Stop unjust evictions.


Alongside housing, I will continue to campaign alongside the people of Dún Laoghaire for:

*    Equality and rights for disabled people and those with special needs
*    Dún Laoghaire harbour as a public amenity to protect its unique heritage
*    A fully accessible Dún Laoghaire Baths - with a swimming pool.
*    Put the responsibility for the housing crisis firmly back on the government and property speculators.
*    Retrofit all council homes in the lifetime of the next council and upfront retrofit grants for homeowners
*    A Women’s refuge for Dún Laoghaire area
*    A fair commercial rates scheme based on profit, not square metres.
*    Extra staff and resources to invest in road safety, maintenance and enhancing areas like Loughlinstown, Ballybrack and Shankill.
*    Playgrounds, amenities and resources for young people
*    Supporting local clubs and community groups as they fight for better facilities
*    Real consultation with local communities for genuinely sustainable development
