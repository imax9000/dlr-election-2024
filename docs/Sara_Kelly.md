My name is Sara Kelly, it was always about animals. As a child my parents thought I  would be a vet. Through the years I've had beloved fur babies.  My last rescue dog was called Sheba, she was the most magical dog, a mix between a Jack Russel and a fox terrier, you could tell she had a hard life but with the right love and care ended up starring in her own short film and was nicknamed the one take dog by the Dublin film makers, as one take was all she needed.  I once nurtured a coup pigeon who flew off course and landed on my window sill one morning,  I named her Effi,  she now lives in a forest with her mate Elvis and a baby of her own. I volunteered in the collon animal sanctuary and marched with Aran.  I'm a vegan nearly 2 years.  I'm a holistic healer, my website is holistichealingforliving and I promote plant based living, I have been directly involved in planetary change happening at this time, as we bring in the new earth of animal rights, plant based living and a return to the golden age.  My hobbies include the arts, singing  and travel.  I trained in the gaiety school of acting for one year, part time, acting for camera.   I played lead roles in 10 short films, one I wrote and directed for kino 2018. I studied jazz singing in 2018 and performed on stage.  I volunteered for years with the spina bifida organisation.  I studied Business studies in the  Dublin business school. I taught English with failte isteach and I am a trained makeup artist.  I am very passionate about animals and believe they have rights and need to be protected from harm and exploitation.  They bring so much joy to the planet and we would be lost without them.
