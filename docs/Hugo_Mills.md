## Nomination

As somebody who has always been interested in politics, and first started campaigning back in 2015 during the Marriage Equality referendum, I am delighted to have the opportunity to stand for the Social Democrats in June’s local elections.

Like many adults in their 30s, I fully understand the frustrations of those who are either locked out of home ownership or face paying exorbitant rents. In fact, while studying to be a barrister during the pandemic, I had to move to Berlin because I could not afford to pay rent in Dublin.

Returning home to Dún Laoghaire to complete my studies meant living in my childhood bedroom – an experience I share with more than 500,000 adults in Ireland.

It is going to take a change of government to reverse years of failed housing policy – but I genuinely believe that the Social Democrats have the ambition and determination to achieve this.

I am also passionate about making Dún Laoghaire a better place to live. More needs to be done to bring vacant and derelict properties in the area back into use, while homelessness must be tackled by scaling up the delivery of social homes.

As a cyclist, I believe the local authority can play a more ambitious role in making cycling and walking much safer. This will be a key priority of mine if I am elected.
