> I am local, having been born and raised in the area. I was educated in St Mary’s Dominican Convent and worked in St Michael’s Hospital until I married Tony and after some years abroad have lived locally and raised our 4 children. Being a busy parent through my children I have strong ties with Cuala GAA Club and Seapoint Rugby Club.
>
> I am a member of Sandycove Lawn Tennis Club and also play some golf when time permits. Particular issues of concern to me include the creation of sustainable employment for our young people, the preservation of our seafront and coastline, implementation of an improved traffic and parking management system, proper funding of local sports facilities and clubs and increased enforcement to ensure a cleaner environment.
