My name is Cathy Lynch and I am running as an independent in the Dun Laoghaire area. I am just an ordinary Irish healthcare worker who has decided to run because I believe our politicians have stopped listening to us, preferring a globalist agenda which does not have the best interests of our communities at heart.

Over the last 4 years, I have campaigned on issues that both central and local government do not want you to know. I (like many) have warned about the dangers of the reckless introduction of an experimental vaccine without any form of Compensation Scheme and the ensuing and alarming rise in Excess Deaths. Most recently, I campaigned for a NO vote in the recent referendums showing that I am more in touch with the community than the government, opposition, NGO’s and other state funded organisations put together! I have also highlighted the lack of independent and unbiased media reporting which is why I, like many, have taken to the streets to provide real, accurate and verifiable evidence that the media either chooses to ignore or doesn’t want you to know. I have highlighted the government’s reckless, uncapped and unvetted migration policy, where most migrants to this shore are economic migrants and not the ‘refugees’ we are being led to believe. This is putting our communities at serious risk.

I have worked tirelessly both in my local community and around the country to inform people of their rights and the obligations of our public servants. And I have not been afraid to ask the hard questions or stand up and be counted to get important information into the public domain. And I have done so with thousands of people just like me – tired of not being heard – tired of globalist agendas taking precedent over the local and national needs of our country. We need a fair and balanced approach – not just rubber stampers.

I will listen and act upon the real needs of the community, not the globalist agenda that ignores the health and wellbeing of individuals and nations. The common good cannot be achieved if the individual is ignored – and that is enshrined in the Preamble of our Constitution. It’s time to bring ‘local’ back into government.

I know times are hard and the cost of living is ever rising but if you can help in any way, however small, it will make a difference not just to me but to your community. Thank you.
